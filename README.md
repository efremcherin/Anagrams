# Anagrams

Write an application that, given a word w and a number n, gives n anagrams of w.

More in detail, write:

1. a Java application, i.e., a class with a main()
2. w via standard input, n via command line (customer)
3. a word is a non-empty sequence of word characters (regex [A-Za-z]+)
4. n is natural
5. anagram: permutation of multisets with repetitions
6. show up to n, whichever you prefer
